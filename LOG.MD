# Project Changes and Challenges Log

## Major Changes

### React Migration
- Migrated from Create React App to a modern Vite + React setup
- Updated project structure and dependencies to work with Vite
- Improved build process and development workflow with faster HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Better development experience with Vite's instant server start

### UI Framework Update
- Updated Material UI to latest version
- Implemented modern styled-components approach using MUI's styled API
- Followed current best practices for component styling and theming
- Improved component reusability and maintainability

### Frontend Architecture Improvements
- Separated API calls into dedicated api.js service file
- Improved code organization with proper separation of concerns
- Better maintainability and reusability of API integration code
- Centralized API endpoint management

### Infrastructure Modernization
- Upgraded to Node.js 22 for improved performance and latest features
- Containerized both frontend and backend applications using Docker
- Implemented Docker Compose for easy development environment setup
- Added volume mounts for real-time development experience

### API Architecture Improvements
- Implemented logging middleware for better request tracking and debugging
- Created MovieConstructor class for handling movie operations
- Added support for studio-to-studio movie transfers
- Improved code organization and maintainability through OOP patterns

## Bug Fixes

### Image Loading Issues
Fixed broken image URLs for several movie posters:
- Aladdin: Updated to correct IMDB media URL
- John Carter: Fixed broken poster link
- Space Jam: Replaced with working image URL
- Slender Man: Updated to official poster URL

All images are now sourced from IMDB's reliable media server (m.media-amazon.com) to ensure consistent availability and loading.

## Challenges Faced

### Image Management
- **Issue**: Multiple movie poster images were returning 404 errors
- **Solution**: Located and implemented correct IMDB media URLs for each broken image
- **Learning**: Using reliable media servers (like IMDB's) is crucial for consistent image availability

### React Migration
- **Issue**: Outdated Create React App setup with legacy dependencies and slower development experience
- **Solution**: Migrated to Vite for a modern, faster development environment
- **Learning**: Vite provides significant improvements in development speed and build performance compared to Create React App
- **Benefit**: Faster development server startup, instant HMR, and better overall developer experience

### Material UI Integration
- **Issue**: Legacy Material UI implementation with outdated styling patterns
- **Solution**: Updated to latest Material UI version with modern styled-components approach
- **Learning**: Modern MUI styled API provides better TypeScript support and more intuitive styling patterns
- **Benefit**: Improved component maintainability and consistent styling across the application

### API Architecture Enhancement
- **Issue**: Lack of structured logging and complex movie operations handling
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented dedicated logging middleware for request tracking
  - Created MovieConstructor class for encapsulating movie-related operations
  - Developed studio transfer functionality with proper validation
- **Learning**: Object-oriented patterns improve code organization and maintainability
- **Benefit**: Better debugging capabilities, cleaner code structure, and more robust movie operations

### Frontend Service Layer
- **Issue**: API calls scattered throughout components making maintenance difficult
- **Solution**: Created centralized api.js service file to handle all API interactions
- **Learning**: Separation of concerns improves code maintainability and testing
- **Benefit**: 
  - Easier to maintain and modify API endpoints
  - Reduced code duplication
  - Better error handling consistency
  - Simplified component logic

### Development Environment
- **Issue**: Inconsistent development environment setup and Node.js version management
- **Solution**: 
  - Upgraded to Node.js 22 across all services
  - Containerized applications with Docker
  - Implemented Docker Compose for orchestration
- **Learning**: Containerization ensures consistent development and deployment environments
- **Benefit**: 
  - Consistent Node.js 22 runtime across services
  - Easy project setup with single docker-compose command
  - Isolated development environments
  - Hot-reload support through volume mounts

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing image fallbacks
- Add image loading states
- Implement image optimization
- Consider using a CDN for media assets

# Development Log

## üìù Changes and Updates

### Environment Configuration
- Added VITE_API_URL environment variable for flexible API endpoint configuration
- Updated the API service layer to use the environment variable
- Ensured proper fallback to local development URLs when needed

### Deployment Updates
- ‚ú® Successfully deployed the application to production
- üîß Set up environment variables for production deployment
- üìö Updated project documentation
- üõ†Ô∏è Configured Vite proxy settings for both development and production

## üêõ Issues Faced and Solutions

### API Configuration
- **Issue**: Needed to expose the application to the internet while maintaining flexibility for local development
- **Solution**: Implemented environment variables (VITE_API_URL) and updated the Vite configuration to handle both scenarios

### Proxy Configuration
- **Issue**: Required different proxy settings for development and production environments
- **Solution**: Updated vite.config.js to use environment variables for the API target, allowing seamless switching between environments
